# SampleDataRangeConverter
Python script with the purpose of converting sample data from [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to another range. 

in my case from -1 to 1 -> 0 250 for the use in ATtiny85 [Drum8](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gtdhhxges6imtbs/AAAuP5Nlg7fQpOyYlpYsshtca?dl=0) by Jan Ostman (his webpage is taken down. R.I.P.)

Script takes in a txt file and outputs a txt file.
ranges and rounding options can be modified.
